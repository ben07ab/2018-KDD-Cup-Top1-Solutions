2018 KDD Cup Top1 Solutions

For many large cities, air pollution has become a severe problem. This yearâ€™s KDD Cup, titled KDD Cup of Fresh Air, solicits machine learning solutions to accurately forecast air quality indices (AQIs) of the future 48 hours. Accurate predictions of AQIs can bring enormous value to governments, enterprises, and the general public - and help them make informed decisions.

KDD Cup of Fresh Air was launched on March 15th and ended on May 31st. Participants were asked to forecast the AQIs of Beijing, China and London, UK. Over 4,000 teams from 49 countries participated in the competition, and made over 20,000 submissions.

The total prize of $36,500 was awarded to the top 10 teams in the regular track and top 3 teams in each of two special tracks. Top teams are invited to present their solutions at the KDD Cup Workshop held on August 21st in London, during the KDD 2018 conference.
